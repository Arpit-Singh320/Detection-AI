**Description of the Code**
The code describes a web-based image upload and analysis system that allows users to upload an image and detect objects within it using AI. The interface is visually enhanced with a starry animated background to create an engaging and interactive experience. The functionality combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with an external AI inference API for image analysis.

**Features**
•Interactive Background: Animated stars create an immersive experience.
•Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across devices of different sizes.
•Real-Time Feedback: Displays messages to inform users about upload and analysis status.
•AI Integration: Utilizes Hugging Face's detr-resnet-50 model for object detection.
•This implementation can be enhanced further with additional features, such as:

Allowing users to download annotated images.
Customizing the confidence threshold for object detection.
Supporting multiple languages in the interface.
