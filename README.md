# Detection AI

**Description of the Code**
The code describes a web-based image upload and analysis system that allows users to upload an image and detect objects within it using AI. The interface is visually enhanced with a starry animated background to create an engaging and interactive experience. The functionality combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with an external AI inference API for image analysis.

**Features**   
•_Interactive Background:_ Animated stars create an immersive experience.   
•_Responsive Design:_ Works seamlessly across devices of different sizes.  
•_Real-Time Feedback:_ Displays messages to inform users about upload and analysis status.   
•_AI Integration:_ Utilizes Hugging Face's detr-resnet-50 model for object detection.  

This implementation can be enhanced further with additional features, such as:    
•Allowing users to download annotated images.
•Customizing the confidence threshold for object detection.
•Supporting multiple languages in the interface.
